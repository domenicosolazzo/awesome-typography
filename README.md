# Awesome Typography
Tips how to use web typography. I am a beginner and I am just learning.

## Key concepts
Web typography has 3 main concepts:
- [**Tone**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): It is the mood or feeling that your typography conveys visually, which is distinct from the tone of the content itself. Tone ranges across a spectrum from informal to formal, and you’ll want to make sure your typography sets the right tone for the message and brand. 
- [**Legibility**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): It defines how easy it is to distinguish between individual letterforms (the shapes of the letters), and is a vital consideration for setting type in user interfaces.
- [**Readability**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): It defines how easy it is to read paragraph content. It’s determined by the font's design and your own design choices, including sizing, spacing, and color.

## Font types
- [**Serif**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): It is used for printed content. It has "terminals" (or serifs) at the end of each letter.
   - Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, Droid Serif
- [**Sans Serif**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): It lacks serifs. It is a standard for the web.
   - Examples: Arial, Verdana, Droid Sans
- [**Monospaced**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Every character takes the same width and they are often used in text editors.
   - Example: Inconsolata
- [**Cursive**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Cursive fonts mimic handwriting. They tend to emphasize visual interest over legibility. They are good for titles and headings.
   - Examples: Indie Flower, Great Vibes
- [**Display**](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Display fonts tend to be either big and bold or hairline thin, and they often have highly complex letterforms.
   - Examples:  Changa One

## Digital typography rules
#### Choosing the font
- [Don't use fancy fonts](https://goo.gl/UmASem)
- [Trajan Pro is not fancy nor old](https://goo.gl/UmASem):It is an elegant font, but not a good match for long text
- [Throw Comic Sans away](https://goo.gl/UmASem)
- [Avoiding default fonts is bullshit](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Better a dull font that one that is unreadable
- [Use a bolder weight to emphasize or add drama to particular passages](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)
- [Pick which weights you use carefully](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Don't load all the weights of a given font. It will slow down the web page.

#### Mixing fonts
- [Don't mix more than two fonts](https://goo.gl/UmASem)
- [Mix only contrasting fonts](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Sans Serif + Serif, a Script font and a modern one
- [Use Typegenius](http://goo.gl/ggyFnF): Use Typegenius for finding a perfect combo
- [Be careful mixing sans serif and serif fonts](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)

#### Setting text
- [Font size](https://goo.gl/UmASem): The font size on the web should be at least 13px, 14-18px is the best
- [Size matters](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Set your main heading (H1) to twice the size of your body font. For the rest of your headings (H2 and down), just lower your size by about 25% per level. 
- [Size matters - Part II](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Use a tool like [Modular Scale](http://goo.gl/xZa72H)
- [Choose the right line length](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Line length is equal text size times two. Keep it between 45 to 75 characters
- [Choose learning suited to the text size](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Easier rule is to set the line height of 125% of text size

#### Line height
- [Set your line-height to around 1.5em](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)

#### Paragraphs
- [Flush left](https://goo.gl/UmASem): If you are not sure, just range left.
- [Avoid hyphenation](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Hyphenation should be avoided whenever possible
- [Don't indent](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Don't indent first line if the paragraph is preceded by title and subtitle
- [Captions](https://goo.gl/UmASem):If text needs to be set narrow consider using condensed typeface
- [Hanging punctuation](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Hang the punctuation marks outside the measure.
- [Windows and orphans](https://goo.gl/UmASem): A widow is a single word or a very short line of text at the end of the paragraph. Orphan is a widow that appears on the top line of the following column or page.
- [Don't overuse word space](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Shift+enter is sufficient to start a new line. Press Enter to start a new paragraph

#### Words
- [Kerning](https://goo.gl/UmASem): If you are not experienced, don't kern manually. Kerning is manually adjusting the spacing between a pair of letters when the digital typeface itself does not do it adequately, common in letters with diagonal stroke such as W or Y
- [Tracking](https://goo.gl/UmASem): When you enlarge fonts size, spacing between letters grows. When setting up large titles, it's advisable to reduce font tracking proportionally
- [Tracking versus Kerning](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Tracking (letter-spacing) differs from kerning in that tracking sets a single distance between all letters, while kerning allows for custom spacing between different letters. 
- [Word spacing dictates the distance between words in a sentence](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): The best word spacing clearly distinguishes different words without forcing the eye to travel too far between them
- [Emphasis in text](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Try using a bold version of the typeface. Don't upper case.
- [Don't letter space the lower case](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Letter spacing lower case hampers legibility
- [Letter space upper case](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Add more letter space between capitals. Readability always benefits from more space between upper case letters.
- [Don't use all caps](https://goo.gl/UmASem): Don't use all caps in text blocks longer than one line of text
- [Pass on small caps](https://goo.gl/UmASem)

#### Letters
- [Don't alter the widths of letters](https://goo.gl/UmASem)

#### Numbers
- [Spell numbers](https://goo.gl/UmASem):

#### Constrast
- [Contrast between text and its background is critical for legibility](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)
- [Best color combination for legibility is dark grey text on a light grey background](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)
- [Try to avoid setting light text on a dark background for long passages](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)
- [When displaying text over an image, make the background as dark as you can](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Consider adding a slight text-shadow on the white text to make it pop

#### Units
- [px are the standard on the web](http://goo.gl/wRMChw)
- [Use relative units](http://goo.gl/wRMChw): Use ems or percentages
